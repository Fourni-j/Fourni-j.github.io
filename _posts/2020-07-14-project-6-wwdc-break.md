This month is a bit different I choose to not release any project, instead I use my time to learn new things. 

# React / Serverless stack

I spend half of the month learning React and what conpose a serverless stack. I want to be able to also release web app for my 12 startups challenge, I'm now more confident in my capacity of releasing a product as a webapp and not only a mobile application. 


I started by following [Serverless Stack](https://serverless-stack.com). It's a great introduction to the serverless concept, at the end you finish with a full serverless web app relying on AWS Lambda.

# WWDC 2020

This year's WWDC was nice, I really enjoyed the new format. The announcment regarding iPad OS design for app motivated me to rethink my existing apps in order to improve iPad experience. 

Widget are also existing and I'm already working on adding widget support for Fridge Buddy.
